# Programming_with_GenAI
Materials related to Programming with Generative AI course from Coursera/IIT Guwahati

IMPORTANT! The version of the coursework as I have it here is often heavily modified, as I used much more modern GenAI than the one for which the course was originally intended (PyCharm integrated JetBrains Assistant using Claude 4 Sonnet, instead much older GitHub Copilot). As such I often created different solutions and went exploring well beyond the scope of the original course (such as creating RESTApi and other pats of iris dataset exploration machine learning project). I keep it here as an inspiration, but use with discretion and caution, as it is not really production-tested code.
